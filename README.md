### Hi there, I'm Karla and I'm a Software Engineer. Thanks for stopping by.ðŸ‘‹


 ðŸ”­ Don't you just hate poorly designed software that doesn't quite do just what you need it to? So do I and I'm doing something about it. Currently I'm working on THE
    ultimate software issue / bug tracking system that will fit like a glove to developers, testers, and anyone needing to deal with those nasty little (and big) bugs!
 
 ðŸŒ± Currently I'm learning a bunch of "stuff" and lovin' it. I'm a strong believer and practioner of life-long learning. I'm a nerd and I'm not ashamed to say it. 
    Right now I'm learning several backend technologies from Node.js, React, and MongoDB to OOP as well as APIs--and I'm lovin' it all.
 
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m especially interested in the power of the human brain. I think it is the greatest piece of software ever built. I never pass up a chance learn more about
    the science of neuroplasticity and how we can actually reprogram the app between our ears to help us live better lives and serve others. 
  
 ðŸ¤” I'm as in love with the behind the scene, in-the-trenches part of development as I am about watching end user's eyes light up when they interact with a new piece of
    software. I have some experience working with SCRUM teams in Agile environments and would jump at the chance to participate in Agile projects.
 
 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my volunteer work teaching underserved kids and adults basic coding and technology fundamentals. I believe technology is to be shared and it is my
    immense pleasure to do so whenever I can.
